Nested VMX
==========

Overview
---------

On Intel processors, KVM uses Intel's VMX (Virtual-Machine eXtensions)
to easily and efficiently run guest operating systems. Normally, these guests
*cannot* themselves be hypervisors running their own guests, because in VMX,
guests cannot use VMX instructions.

The "Nested VMX" feature adds this missing capability - of running guest
hypervisors (which use VMX) with their own nested guests. It does so by
allowing a guest to use VMX instructions, and correctly and efficiently
emulating them using the single level of VMX available in the hardware.

We describe in much greater detail the theory behind the nested VMX feature,
its implementation and its performance characteristics, in the OSDI 2010 paper
"The Turtles Project: Design and Implementation of Nested Virtualization",
available at:

	http://www.usenix.org/events/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Ben-Yehuda.pdf


Terminology
-----------

Single-level virtualization has two levels - the host (KVM) and the guests.
In nested virtualization, we have three levels: The host (KVM), which we call
L0, the guest hypervisor, which we call L1, and its nested guest, which we
call L2.


Known limitations
-----------------

The current code supports running Linux guests under KVM guests.
Only 64-bit guest hypervisors are supported.

Additional patches for running Windows under guest KVM, and Linux under
guest VMware server, and support for nested EPT, are currently running in
the lab, and will be sent as follow-on patchsets.


Running nested VMX
------------------

The nested VMX feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled by giving
the "nested=1" option to the kvm-intel module.

No modifications are required to user space (qemu). However, qemu's default
emulated CPU type (qemu64) does not list the "VMX" CPU feature, so it must be
explicitly enabled, by giving qemu one of the following options:

     -cpu host              (emulated CPU has all features of the real CPU)

     -cpu qemu64,+vmx       (add just the vmx feature to a named CPU type)


ABIs
----

Nested VMX aims to present a standard and (eventually) fully-functional VMX
implementation for the a guest hypervisor to use. As such, the official
specification of the ABI that it provides is Intel's VMX specification,
namely volume 3B of their "Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
Developer's Manual". Not all of VMX's features are currently fully supported,
but the goal is to eventually support them all, starting with the VMX features
which are used in practice by popular hypervisors (KVM and others).

As a VMX implementation, nested VMX presents a VMCS structure to L1.
As mandated by the spec, other than the two fields revision_id and abort,
this structure is *opaque* to its user, who is not supposed to know or care
about its internal structure. Rather, the structure is accessed through the
VMREAD and VMWRITE instructions.
Still, for debugging purposes, KVM developers might be interested to know the
internals of this structure; This is struct vmcs12 from arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c.
For convenience, we repeat its content here. If the internals of this structure
changes, this can break live migration across KVM versions. VMCS12_REVISION
(from vmx.c) should be changed if struct vmcs12 or its inner struct shadow_vmcs
is ever changed.

struct __packed vmcs12 {
	/* According to the Intel spec, a VMCS region must start with the
	 * following two fields. Then follow implementation-specific data.
	 */
	u32 revision_id;
	u32 abort;

	struct vmcs_fields fields;

	bool launch_state; /* set to 0 by VMCLEAR, to 1 by VMLAUNCH */
}
